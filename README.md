Step 1: Sign In to IBM Cloud
Log in to your IBM Cloud account using your credentials.

Step 2: Access the Visual Recognition Service
Navigate to the IBM Cloud Dashboard.

Step 3: Create or Select a Visual Recognition Service
If you haven't already created a Visual Recognition service, you can create a new resource by clicking "Create Resource" or "Create Service."

Step 4: Configure the Service
Set up your Visual Recognition service by choosing a service plan (e.g., "Lite" plan) and giving it a name. Follow the prompts to create the service.

Step 5: Retrieve API Key and Endpoint
After creating the service, go to the service instance in your IBM Cloud Dashboard.

Step 6: Upload the Image
Within the service, you can typically find an option to upload an image. This could be part of the service's user interface or through an API call.

Step 7: Choose the Image

Select the image you want to upload from your local device.

Step 8: Initiate Image Recognition
Once the image is uploaded, you may need to initiate image recognition through the service. This could be done automatically or through a specific API request.

Step 9: Retrieve Recognition Results
The Visual Recognition service will process the image and provide recognition results, which may include labels, captions, or other information related to the image.

Step 10: View or Use the Results
You can view and use the recognition results as needed for your application, whether displaying them to the user or using them for further processing.
